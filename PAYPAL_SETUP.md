# PayPal Payment Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up PayPal payments for your Google Pins marketplace. The integration is designed to be simple and secure.

## üöÄ Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create PayPal Developer Account

1. **Visit PayPal Developer Portal**: Go to [https://developer.paypal.com/](https://developer.paypal.com/)
2. **Sign In**: Use your existing PayPal account or create a new one
3. **Navigate to Apps**: Click on "My Apps & Credentials"

### 2. Create a PayPal Application

1. **Create New App**: Click "Create App" button
2. **Fill App Details**:
   - **App Name**: `Google Pins Marketplace` (or your preferred name)
   - **Merchant**: Select your business account or leave default
   - **Features**: Select "Accept payments"
   - **Products**: Select "Checkout" under "Accept Payments"

3. **Choose Environment**:
   - **Sandbox**: For testing (recommended to start with)
   - **Live**: For production (only when ready to accept real payments)

### 3. Get Your API Credentials

After creating the app, you'll see:
- **Client ID**: A public identifier for your app
- **Client Secret**: A private key (keep this secure!)

### 4. Configure Your Environment

1. **Copy your `.env.example` to `.env.local`**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Add your PayPal credentials to `.env.local`**:
   ```env
   # PayPal Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_here
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
   ```

   **Important**: 
   - Replace `your_actual_client_id_here` with your real Client ID
   - Replace `your_actual_client_secret_here` with your real Client Secret
   - Keep `sandbox` for testing, change to `live` for production

### 5. Update Your Database

Run the database migration to add the orders tables:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**: Go to your Supabase project
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**: In the left sidebar
3. **Run the Migration**: Copy and paste the contents of `database-migration.sql` and execute it

### 6. Test the Integration

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Add items to cart**: Browse pin packs and add some to your cart
3. **Test checkout**: Go to `/cart` and click "Proceed to Checkout"
4. **Use PayPal sandbox account**: 
   - Email: `sb-test@personal.example.com`
   - Password: `testpassword123`
   - Or create your own sandbox account in the PayPal Developer Dashboard

## üîß Configuration Options

### Sandbox vs Live Environment

**Sandbox (Testing)**:
- Use for development and testing
- No real money is transferred
- PayPal provides test accounts
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox`

**Live (Production)**:
- Use for real payments
- Real money will be transferred
- Requires business verification
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=live`

### Payment Flow

1. **User clicks checkout** ‚Üí Cart shows PayPal buttons
2. **PayPal payment** ‚Üí User completes payment on PayPal
3. **Order completion** ‚Üí Our system records the successful payment
4. **Download access** ‚Üí User gets access to purchased pin packs

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- **Never commit** `.env.local` to version control
- **Keep Client Secret secure** - never expose it in client-side code
- **Use HTTPS** in production for secure payment processing
- **Test thoroughly** in sandbox before going live

## üß™ Testing with Sandbox

PayPal provides test accounts for sandbox testing:

**Test Credit Card**:
- Card Number: `4111111111111111`
- Expiry: Any future date
- CVV: `123`

**Test PayPal Account**:
- You can create test accounts in the PayPal Developer Dashboard
- Or use the default sandbox accounts provided

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "PayPal Not Configured" Error**:
- Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` is set in your `.env.local`
- Restart your development server after adding environment variables

**2. "Payment Failed" Error**:
- Verify your credentials are correct
- Check that you're using the right environment (sandbox/live)
- Look at browser console for detailed error messages

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
